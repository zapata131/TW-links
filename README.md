# Technical Writing links

A simple page with useful resources for Technical Writers. You can visit it at
<technicalwriting.link>.

This site uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the
[Biscuit](http://sblisesivdin.github.io/biscuit) theme to build the page and
deploy it to my personal hosting.

You can contribute to this repository by forking it, modifing the
`twlinks/index.md` file, and creating a PR.
