## About

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is a side project by me, **JosÃ© Luis Zapata**. I'm a technical writer that
wants to share interesting resources and wanted to learn a bit about Jekyll.

You can find more about me on my [landing page][zapata-landing] or on
[BufferBuffer][bufferbuffer], my Technical Writing blog. You can also take a
look at [the repository on GitHub][tw-links-repo].

These resources helped me kickstart my career as a technical writer. I'm only
suggesting stuff I've found interesting and helpful. If you want me to take a
look at a specific resource, [send an email][zapata-landing] and I'll check it
out.
