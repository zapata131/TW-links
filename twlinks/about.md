# About Technical Writing links

This is a side project by **Jos√© Luis Zapata**. I'm a Technical Writer that
wants to share interesting resources and wanted to learn a bit about Jekyll.

You can find more about me on my [landing page][zapata-landing] or on
[BufferBuffer][bufferbuffer], my Technical Writing blog.


You can contribute to this project creating a pull request in the official repo,
[TW-links](https://github.com/zapata131/TW-links)
